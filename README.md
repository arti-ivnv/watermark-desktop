# watermark-desktop v1.0

## About

<pre>
This program is made out of [watermark-app] repository which is a web version. 
It puts any png watermark to the image or set of images in format of png, jpeg, jpg.
Special thanks to my friend Max and his videography department for giving me an opportunity 
to create this software for them. Since I made this project for free, 
I have decided to make it open source. :)

## Project contains
• Source code <br>
• Compiled and assembled program (download and use)

## Installation (usage)
For current version, I messed up doing an installer, so I made an executable runner.<br>
The only thing you need to do:
1) Download folder ```watermark_prod folder``` which you can find in ```~/watermark-desktop/exec/```
2) run ```Watermark.exe```

## Usage 
In case to modify my program you need JDK which is compatible with JFX v18.*

## Version v1.1 modifications (in progress)
1) English language support
2) Text version of watermark (typed / txt file uploaded)
3) Different watermark patterns (it is ready but requires some improvements)
