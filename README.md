# watermark-desktop v2.0

<pre>
This program is made out of [watermark-app] repository which is a web version. 
It puts any png watermark to the image or set of images in format of png, jpeg, jpg.
Special thanks to my friend Max and his videography department for giving me an opportunity 
to create this software for them. Since I made this project for free, 
I have decided to make it open source. :)

## Installation
For current version, I messed up doing an installer, so I made an executable runner.<br>
